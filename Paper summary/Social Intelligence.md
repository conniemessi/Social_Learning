The Social Intelligence Profile focuses on understanding and measuring an individual's social intelligence, which is defined as the ability to get along well with others and build positive relationships. Albrecht identifies four social styles:

- Director: Direct and assertive, focused on tasks and results.
- Thinker: Analytical and detail-oriented, values accuracy and precision.
- Relater: Relationship-oriented, emphasizes harmony and cooperation.
- Socializer: Outgoing and expressive, enjoys socializing and influencing others.

The theory suggests that people have a dominant and a secondary social style, influencing their behavior and interactions. The website likely provides more in-depth information on each style and practical applications of the Social Intelligence Profile theory.
