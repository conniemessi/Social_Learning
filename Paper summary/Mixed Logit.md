Learning Mixed Logit Choice Model with Neural Network: Global Convergence and Generalization Bound

**One sentence Summary**: The document explores the use of a neural network model to estimate the mixing distribution in mixed logit models, demonstrating its global convergence, generalization capabilities, and competitive performance compared to existing benchmarks.

The document highlights the theoretical guarantees of the neural network model, demonstrating its convergence to the global optimal solution for maximum likelihood estimation and squared loss minimization. It also provides a bound on the generalization gap, proving that over-parameterization does not compromise generalization on unseen data.

The methodology included a mean-field analysis to demonstrate the global convergence of the neural network model, theoretical proofs for the convergence and generalization capabilities, and empirical performance evaluations using synthetic and real datasets. 

Overall, the document comprehensively explores the neural network model's effectiveness in learning complex choice models, providing valuable insights into its robustness, convergence, and generalization capabilities across different datasets and scenarios.

Key quotes from the document include:
- "Using a mean-field analysis on the infinite-width neural network model, we show that the noisy gradient descent algorithm converges exponentially fast to the global optimal solution for maximum likelihood estimation and squared loss minimization."
- "We bound the gap between the infinite-width model and the finite-width model, which decays inverse proportionally to the width of the hidden layer."
- "By developing a bound on the generalization gap that is independent of the width of the hidden layer, we prove that over-parameterization does not compromise generalization on unseen data."
- "We empirically demonstrate the competitive in-sample and out-of-sample performance of our approach as compared to other benchmarks that estimate mixed logit models under synthetic and real datasets."
