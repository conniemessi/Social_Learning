The paper extends binary choice models with social networks under heterogeneous rational expectations. The authors move beyond homogeneous rational expectations to consider individual-specific characteristics when forming expectations about peers' behaviors. They establish conditions for unique equilibrium and explore the impacts of endogenous, contextual, and correlated effects in the models. The study focuses on adolescents' smoking behaviors and finds significant effects even after controlling for school-grade random effects. The inclusion of social networks and heterogeneous rational expectations enhances the realism of the models, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of decision-making processes in social settings. The paper provides valuable insights into the complexities of social interactions and decision-making behaviors, particularly in the context of binary choice models with heterogeneous rational expectations.

 
**- The key differences between the binary choice complete network model and the general network model with heterogeneous rational expectations?**

The key differences between the binary choice complete network model and the general network model with heterogeneous rational expectations are as follows:

1. **Homogeneous vs. Heterogeneous Rational Expectations**:
   - In the binary choice complete network model, individuals have homogeneous rational expectations, meaning they form expectations regarding peers' behaviors without considering individual-specific characteristics.
   - In the general network model with heterogeneous rational expectations, individuals take into account peers' characteristics when forming rational expectations about their behaviors, leading to heterogeneous expectations among different peers.

2. **Equilibrium Determination**:
   - In the binary choice complete network model, the model consistent group expectation is determined as a rational expectation equilibrium (RE) using an equilibrium equation, with potential multiple equilibria under strong social interactions.
   - In the general network model with heterogeneous rational expectations, the equilibrium is a vector of expectations and is a solution of a system of nonlinear equations, making the determination of the number of solutions more complex.

3. **Model Complexity**:
   - The binary choice complete network model assumes a simpler homogeneous rational expectations framework suitable for large group interactions.
   - The general network model with heterogeneous rational expectations introduces more complexity by considering individual-specific characteristics and expectations in smaller group interactions.

These differences highlight the evolution from a more simplistic homogeneous rational expectations model to a more nuanced heterogeneous rational expectations model in the context of social network interactions in binary choice models.
