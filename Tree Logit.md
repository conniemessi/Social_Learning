The paper "Estimating Large-Scale Tree Logit Models" introduces a novel and efficient estimation method for large-scale tree logit models. The key focus is on developing a scalable majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm that simplifies the likelihood problem by solving a sequence of optimization problems with simpler surrogate objective functions. Through a variable transformation, the non-convex log-likelihood function is converted into a convex function in the mean utility parameters and a difference of strictly convex functions in the nest dissimilarity parameters. This structural exploitation allows for the design of an efficient MM algorithm with strong theoretical guarantees for the resulting solutions.

The proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art optimization methods, demonstrating faster convergence rates and significantly lower negative log-likelihood values on both synthetic and real data. By addressing the limitations of existing optimization algorithms, such as numerical stability issues and lack of scalability to large problem instances, this method provides a robust and reliable approach for estimating complex tree logit models efficiently. The paper's contributions advance the field of choice modeling by offering a practical, scalable, and theoretically sound solution for estimating large-scale tree logit models.
